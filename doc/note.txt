note:
node_modules file contains the express project generator. It has nothing to do with project.

when retrieve data from mongodb, use '-_id' syntax to avoid get the '_id' that is a default filed.
ex:			get 'restaurant_name'
			should type 'restaurant_name -_id' 

in router folder, '/' is '/RouterName'.Because the app.use('path', RouterName) contains 'path' parameter.
ex: get('/', callback()) in router folder means,
	get will be performed in the path '/RouterName'

module.exports = mongoose.model('Users', UserSchema);
the object we export is 'Users';

progress:
1, generate the express project structure;
2, current router: only home page;
3, next:    design login page (how do we prompt login page?);
            loading map;
